 1.0 (November 11, 2014)
=========================
Renamed mod to Simulator Overhaul (was All Ships in Refit Battles)
Mod now requires LazyLib to function
Changes since alpha:
 - Added config file sim_settings.json, can customize how the mod works here
 - Newly unlocked campaign sim opponents will be announced after battle is over
 - Full opponent list appears at the start of a simulation (you don't need to
   close and reopen the opponents list for all known ships to show up)
 - Allied reserves are infinitely respawnable in campaign simulations
   (known bug: replacement allies don't benefit from fleet-wide skill effects)
   (known bug: replacement allies have 60% CR regardless of original value)
 - Mission simulation reserves now infinite, sorted, uses sim_opponents.csv
 - Changed how persistent data is handled (will automatically import old data)
 - Minor optimizations and code cleanup
