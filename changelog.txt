 1.2 (November 19, 2015)
=========================
Updated to be compatible with Starsector 0.7a
Combined unlocked ships and wings into one notification (less spammy)
Fixed issues with reserves not regenerating after using F8 in devmode
Changes to SimMaster:
 - Added getDefaultOpponents(), returns starting sim list
 - Added resetSimList(), resets list to only include default opponents

 1.1b (October 23, 2015)
=========================
Fixed missing variant crash after using F8 in devmode
 - Ships will still be missing from the list after using F8, just doesn't crash

 1.1 (October 03, 2015)
========================
Rewrite of reserve respawning logic to be much more efficient
Unexported custom variants in player's fleet now respawn properly
Hulls are sorted at the very end of the sim opponent list
Moved configuration files to data/config/simulator
Added "cleanUpHulks" setting, deletes hulks in sim after 30 seconds if true
Added "infiniteCR" setting, gives ships in sim infinite combat readiness if true
Added "healOnVictory" setting, restores player ship when all enemies are dead
Added "includeHulls" setting, adds all known hulls to sim opponent list if true
Added "useVanillaSimListWithStarsector+" setting, defaults to true
Added starting_sim_opponents.csv:
 - Allows other mods to add ships/wings to the starting sim list without having
   to be unlocked by fighting them first
 - Does nothing if Starsector+ is activated as unlocking is disabled with that
   mod active

 1.0c (November 11, 2014)
==========================
Re-enabled infinite reserves and sorted opponent lists for Starsector+
(ship unlocking is still disabled when playing SS+ due to its random variants)

 1.0b (November 11, 2014)
==========================
Fix for crash when you allow your second in command to fight a battle
Use sim_opponents.csv and vanilla behavior when Starsector+ is installed

 1.0 (November 11, 2014)
=========================
Renamed mod to Simulator Overhaul (was All Ships in Refit Battles)
Mod now requires LazyLib to function
Changes since alpha:
 - Added config file sim_settings.json, can customize how the mod works here
 - Newly unlocked campaign sim opponents will be announced after battle is over
 - Full opponent list appears at the start of a simulation (you don't need to
   close and reopen the opponents list for all known ships to show up)
 - Allied reserves are infinitely respawnable in campaign simulations
   (known bug: replacement allies don't benefit from fleet-wide skill effects)
   (known bug: replacement allies have 60% CR regardless of original value)
 - Mission simulation reserves now infinite, sorted, uses sim_opponents.csv
 - Changed how persistent data is handled (will automatically import old data)
 - Minor optimizations and code cleanup
