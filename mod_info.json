This mod also changes reserves so they are sorted by hull size and are replenished instantly after spawning a ship, along with several other features that can be toggled in data/config/simulator/sim_settings.json.\n\nOpponent unlocking is disabled when run alongside DynaSector, in which case vanilla sim_opponents.csv behavior will be used instead.",
